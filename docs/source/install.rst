Installation
============

The :mod:`focal_loss` package can be installed using the
`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__ utility. For the latest version,
install directly from the package's
`GitHub page <https://github.com/artemmavrin/focal-loss>`__:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/artemmavrin/focal-loss.git

Alternatively, install a recent release from the
`Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/project/focal-loss>`__:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install focal-loss

.. note::

    To install the project for development (e.g., to make changes to the
    source code), clone the project repository from GitHub and run
    :code:`make dev`:

    .. code-block:: bash

        git clone https://github.com/artemmavrin/focal-loss.git
        cd focal-loss
        # Optional but recommended: create and activate a new environment first
        make dev

    This will additionally install the requirements needed
    to run tests, check code coverage, and produce documentation.
